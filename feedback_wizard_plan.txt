Window title: Feedback setup wizard

TODO: convince people we should not:
  Show learned value, have a button for resetting, don't do sampling when we
  click the Next button.

TODO: warn if PID period or accel/decel parameters are too slow?

TODO:
  Feedback tab: put Learn button in better place, make it clear it applied to all.
  "Feedback setup wizard..." upper left, reset upper right.

TODO:
  Nice "Feedback setup wizard..." button under the "n" of "Invert motor direction"

TODO: look into justifying text and making margins even on the sides
